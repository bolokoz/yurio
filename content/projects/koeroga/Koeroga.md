# Market research

## Scope

### 1. Vision

Introduce affordable, mobile tiny homes as a **fast, flexible housing solution** that transforms idle urban lots into income-generating spaces.

### 2. Objectives

- Develop **cost-efficient, mobile prefab units** leveraging local labor.
    
- Deploy units for **dual use**:
    
    - **Direct rental/subrental model** (fleet owned by company).
        
    - **Sales to landowners/investors** (turnkey rental-ready units).
        
- Establish a **recognizable brand** as the pioneer of prefab/mobile housing in the region.
    
- Achieve **fast turnover cycles** (build → deploy → generate income quickly).
    

### 3. Scope of Work

- **Design & Standardization**:
    
    - Create **1–2 core models** of mobile tiny homes (20–35 m²).
        
    - Focus on **simplicity, durability, and easy mobility**.
        
- **Production**:
    
    - Use **cheap local labor + streamlined materials sourcing**.
        
    - Target **low-cost, high-speed assembly**.
        
- **Deployment**:
    
    - Place units on **empty/underused urban lots**.
        
    - Operate units as **short- or mid-term rentals**.
        
    - Option for **turnkey sales** to clients who want to run rentals themselves.
        
- **Business Model**:
    
    - **Company-owned rental fleet**: recurring income.
        
    - **Unit sales + service**: fast cash flow.

## Target Market

🔑 Positioning Sentence

**“We build affordable mobile tiny homes that give renters modern housing at better prices, help landowners turn idle lots into income, and give investors turnkey rental opportunities.”**

### 1. Renters

- **R$1,500 avg rent vs R$4,000 avg income** → Rent is ~38% of income (a bit heavy).
    
- **Problem**: Lack of modern, affordable options close to city center.
    
- **Opportunity**:
    
    - Offer **modern units at R$1,000–1,200** (20–30% cheaper than current avg).
        
    - Market as _“modern, central, private housing for less than a 1-bedroom apartment.”_
        
    - Position: better than old apartments, closer than far-away ones.
        

---

### 2. Landowners with Empty Lots

- **High land value growth → they wait instead of building**.
    
- **Problem**: land generates no income, but keeps costing small taxes.
    
- **Opportunity**:
    
    - Offer **revenue-share deals** (e.g., you place units, share 20–30% of rent).
        
    - Position: _“Turn your idle land into income without construction risk.”_
        
    - Low resistance: since taxes are low, they don’t feel urgency, but **sharing income with no cost** is attractive.
        

---

### 3. Investors

- **Have money but lack initiative/opportunities.**
    
- **No strong Airbnb culture** → long-term rental more relevant than tourism.
    
- **Opportunity**:
    
    - Sell **turnkey rental units** (you build + place on land you secured).
        
    - Show them **clear ROI math** (e.g., buy unit for R$90k, rent for R$1,200/mo → payback in ~6 years, but cheaper if shared or multiple units).
        
    - Position: _“Prefab rental unit: predictable cash flow, no headaches.”_
        

---

### 4. Housing Market Context

- **Land is prohibitively expensive**, so few new projects.
    
- **Construction is too costly**, so only bigger players or amateurs try.
    
- **No small apartments, only old stock.**
    
- **Opportunity**:
    
    - You are **filling the missing middle** → small, affordable, modern housing.
        
    - You can **scale faster than traditional builders** since you avoid land purchase + heavy construction.
        

---

 🎯 Strategic Takeaways

- **Primary target**: Renters → ensure pricing undercuts old apartments by ~20%.
    
- **Channel to renters**: position as _“modern + central + affordable”_.
    
- **Enablers**: Landowners → give you placement opportunities.
    
- **Growth fuel**: Investors → provide cash to scale unit production.


## ROI

I’ll assume some **unit build costs** (we can adjust later with your real numbers):

- Small mobile unit (20–25m²): **R$80k–R$100k** build cost.
    
- Rent price target: **R$1,000–1,200/month** (below market avg of R$1,500).
    
- Basic operating costs (maintenance, management, insurance, utilities not included in rent): **~10% of revenue**.

📌 ROI Models for Mobile Tiny Homes

### 1. **Conservative Scenario**

- **Build cost/unit**: R$100,000
    
- **Rent/month**: R$1,000
    
- **Annual revenue**: R$12,000
    
- **Net after 10% expenses**: R$10,800
    
- **Payback period**: ~9.3 years
    
- **ROI/year**: ~10.8%
    

---

### 2. **Base Scenario**

- **Build cost/unit**: R$90,000
    
- **Rent/month**: R$1,200
    
- **Annual revenue**: R$14,400
    
- **Net after 10% expenses**: R$12,960
    
- **Payback period**: ~6.9 years
    
- **ROI/year**: ~14.4%
    

---

### 3. **Aggressive Scenario**

- **Build cost/unit**: R$80,000
    
- **Rent/month**: R$1,200
    
- **Annual revenue**: R$14,400
    
- **Net after 10% expenses**: R$12,960
    
- **Payback period**: ~6.2 years
    
- **ROI/year**: ~16.2%
    

---

💡 Observations

- Even conservative returns (~10% ROI) **beat typical savings, bonds, or local real estate yields**.
    
- With optimized costs (R$80–90k per unit), you’re hitting **14–16% ROI**, which is excellent for investors.
    
- **Fleet model (your rentals)** compounds faster: instead of selling, you hold units and enjoy recurring cash flow.
    
- **Revenue share with landowners**:
    
    - Example: if rent is R$1,200, and you split 70/30 → landowner gets R$360, you keep R$840.
        
    - That still works for payback (just ~2 years longer).

### 📌 Is 10% ROI Good?

- **Local benchmark**: In Brazil/Paraguay, traditional residential rentals typically yield **0.5–0.8%/month** (6–9% per year).
    
- **Your conservative model** gave ~10.8%/year net → **already above market average**.
    
- **Base & aggressive scenarios** (14–16% ROI) are **very attractive** for small investors.
    

So yes — **10% is good compared to standard real estate**, but investors will care about **depreciation & resale value** too.

---

### 📌 Depreciation in Prefab/Mobile Units

- A traditional brick house **appreciates with land** → safer for investors.
    
- A mobile prefab is a **movable asset**, more like a vehicle:
    
    - **Depreciates over time**, especially if poorly maintained.
        
    - But **can be relocated** to a better lot (flexibility offsets risk).
        
- Typical depreciation assumption:
    
    - **5–7%/year** straight-line over 15–20 years.
        
    - Residual value after 10 years: ~40–50% of original cost if maintained.
        

---

### 📌 Adjusted ROI with Depreciation

Example with **Base Scenario** (R$90k unit, R$1,200 rent):

- Net annual cash flow: R$12,960
    
- Depreciation: ~R$4,500/year (5% of R$90k)
    
- **True net** (cash flow – depreciation): ~R$8,460/year
    
- Effective ROI after depreciation: **9.4%**
