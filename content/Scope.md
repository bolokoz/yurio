# Scope
## 1. Vision

Introduce affordable, mobile tiny homes as a **fast, flexible housing solution** that transforms idle urban lots into income-generating spaces.

## 2. Objectives

- Develop **cost-efficient, mobile prefab units** leveraging local labor.
    
- Deploy units for **dual use**:
    
    - **Direct rental/subrental model** (fleet owned by company).
        
    - **Sales to landowners/investors** (turnkey rental-ready units).
        
- Establish a **recognizable brand** as the pioneer of prefab/mobile housing in the region.
    
- Achieve **fast turnover cycles** (build → deploy → generate income quickly).
    

## 3. Scope of Work

- **Design & Standardization**:
    
    - Create **1–2 core models** of mobile tiny homes (20–35 m²).
        
    - Focus on **simplicity, durability, and easy mobility**.
        
- **Production**:
    
    - Use **cheap local labor + streamlined materials sourcing**.
        
    - Target **low-cost, high-speed assembly**.
        
- **Deployment**:
    
    - Place units on **empty/underused urban lots**.
        
    - Operate units as **short- or mid-term rentals**.
        
    - Option for **turnkey sales** to clients who want to run rentals themselves.
        
- **Business Model**:
    
    - **Company-owned rental fleet**: recurring income.
        
    - **Unit sales + service**: fast cash flow.
        
    - Potential **lot-partner deals**: landowner provides space, you provide unit, revenue share.
        

## 4. Out of Scope

- Permanent residential developments.
    
- Luxury/high-complexity prefabs.
    
- Commercial-only prefab units (offices, schools, etc.).
    

## 5. Success Metrics

- Average **build time per unit**: < 4 weeks.
    
- Occupancy rate of rentals: > 70%.
    
- Payback period per unit: < 3 years.
    
- Number of units deployed in year 1: 10–20.
